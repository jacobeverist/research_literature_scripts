# Problem

I use the following applications and devices for my research, writing, and reading:
- Obsidian MD
- Zotero
- Scrivener
- Remarkable 2

I need ways to integrate their data and leverage their various strengths.

# Scripting Tools to Manage My Research Literature

I mostly use MacOS, but these should work on any OS.

Script to move PDFs to Remarkable while preserving the directory structure on the tablet OS
- `remarkable_migrate_papers.py`

Example script for bulk-renaming of files in the file system based on a regular expression and renaming based on regex groups
- `rename_files.py`

Zotero API query to list files on Zotero hosting service
- `zotero_list_collection.py`


Scrivener compilation pipeline scripts.  Uses Scrivomatic, Pandocomatic, Pandoc, Biber, and Xelatex
- [scrivener_workflow](scrivener_workflow)
